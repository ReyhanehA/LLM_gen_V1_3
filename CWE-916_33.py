#4.# CWE-916: Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort
# Vulnerable line: password_hash = hashlib.sha512(password.encode()).hexdigest()
# Description: The SHA-512 hashing algorithm used here is not secure enough for password storage as it can be easily cracked with modern computing power.
