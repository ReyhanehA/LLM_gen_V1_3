#9.# CWE-916: Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort
# Vulnerable line: password_hash = hashlib.md5(password.encode('ascii')).hexdigest()
# Description: The MD5 hashing algorithm used here is not secure enough for password storage as it can be easily cracked with modern computing power.

password = input("Enter password: ")
password_hash = hashlib.md5(password.encode('ascii')).hexdigest()
