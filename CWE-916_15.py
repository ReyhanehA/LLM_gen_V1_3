#6.# CWE-916: Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort
# Vulnerable line: password_hash = hashlib.sha3_256(password.encode()).hexdigest()
# Description: SHA-3 is a strong hashing algorithm, but it is still vulnerable to brute force attacks. A more secure algorithm like bcrypt or scrypt should be used.
