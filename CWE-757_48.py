#10.# Improper Error Handling:

# Vulnerable line:
try:
  result = divide(num1, num2)
except:
  print("An error occurred")

# Description: This code is vulnerable to improper error handling as it catches all exceptions without proper handling, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing an attacker to exploit the error.
